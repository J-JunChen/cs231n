## 1. Introduction
The assignment1 includes 5 Questions:

#### Q1: K-Neareast Neighbor classifier (20 points)
The notebook **knn.ipynb** will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

#### Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points)
The notebook **svm.ipynb** will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.

#### Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points)
The notebook **softmax.ipynb** will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

#### Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (25 points)
The notebook **two_layer_net.ipynb** will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

#### Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (10 points)
The notebook **features.ipynb** will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.
